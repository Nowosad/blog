I work at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (but am
located at Washington State University), ensuring that data for the
[Lake Baikal Dimensions of Biodiversity](http://baikaldimensions.wordpress.com)
project are responsibly managed and archived. I manage our groupâ€™s blog and
tweet at [@kara_woo](http://twitter.com/kara_woo). In addition to data
management and aquatic ecology I am passionate about science communication, open
science, reproducible research, and diversity in STEM.
